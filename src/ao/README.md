## The OpenCollar AO

###### A ZHAO II based animation overrider with graphical user interface.

Formerly "OpenCollar Sub AO", there is not much new compared to the legacy variation except that it is distributed now with share-alike button textures that can be found in the ./res directory of this repo and that it is less chatty when connecting to the OpenCollar device.
