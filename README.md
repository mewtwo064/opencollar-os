### Welcome to OpenCollar Six™

OpenCollar Six is a set of LSL scripts and other creative content, such as animations, sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices in the form of scripted accessory and/or so-called HUDs for the metaverse.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became everyone's script set of choice to create items that are used for creative role play amongst adults in Second Life®. OpenCollar is [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "What is free software?")."

#### OpenSim Porting Information

For now, we target and test for OpenSim 0.8 and OpenSim 0.9. Support for OpenSim 0.8 will be ceased from the moment OpenSim 0.9 is released.

This is the master branch, which is a port of OpenCollar Six  
Check out the oscollar3 branch for a legacy port based on OpenCollar 3.99x

There are some differences between the v3 and Six collars, for instance Six is much more optimized thanks to certain scripts being in seperate links (which can be optionally invisible, but you do need them seperate).

If you are looking to directly convert or upgrade existing v3 collars for OpenSim, you can use the oscollar3 branch which should be 100% compatible with the last v3 version in Second Life. We haven't made a transmuter tool yet to convert a v3 collar to Six.

A ready made standard OpenCollar for both branches can be be aquired at the OsGrid Sim ['Kinky Hub'](http://opensimworld.com/hop/77066-Kinky-Hub). Creators can use this standard collar as a technical reference for making new products.
